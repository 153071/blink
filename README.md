A <1 MB minimal break notifier program. Helps you remeber to blink during long computer usage.

## Building

I used some tricks from [min-sized-rust](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust) to optimize the binary size.
Use the `build.sh` script to build the program with optimized size results.
